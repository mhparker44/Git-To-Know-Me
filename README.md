# hello-world

I am an Industrial Engineering Student at NC State graduating December, 2019.
I am a Pre-Sales intern at SAS Institute, and interned in Technical Support for the previous 2 years. 
I am searching for a Pre-Sales or Consulting job after graduation.
Please contact me if you have any questions!
